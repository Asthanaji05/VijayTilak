        <h1>Raja Raja Chola</h1>
        <P>
          He was the most powerful Tamil king in South India during his reign and is remembered for reinstating the Chola influence and ensuring its supremacy across the Indian Ocean.
        </P>
        <p>
          His extensive empire included vast regions of the Pandya country, the Chera country and northern Sri Lanka. He also acquired Lakshadweep and Thiladhunmadulu atoll, and part of the northern-most islands of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Campaigns against the Western Gangas and the Chalukyas extended the Chola authority as far as the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast, he battled with the Chalukyas for the possession of Vengi
        </p>
        <h3>Rajarajeshwaram Temple</h3>
        <p>
          Rajaraja I, being an able administrator, also built the great Rajarajeshwaram Temple at the Chola capital Thanjavur
          The temple is regarded as the foremost of all temples constructed in the medieval south Indian architectural style.
        </p>
        <h3>Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
          Comparing Rajaraja's campaign to the invasion of Lanka by the legendary hero Rama, the Thiruvalangadu Plates states:<br>

"Rama built with the aid of monkeys, a causeway across the sea, and then with great difficulties defeated the king of Lanka by means of sharp edged arrows. But Rama was excelled by this king whose powerful army crossed the ocean by ships and burnt up the king of Lanka."

<br>— Thiruvalangadu Copper Plates
        </p>
        <h4>Rajaraja called himself Shivapada Shekhara, literally, "the one who places his crown at the feet of Shiva".</h4>
        <h1>Rajendra Chola, son of Raja Raja Chola</h1>
        <p>
          Rajendra the Great, and also known as Gangaikonda Chola<b>{Bringer of the Ganges}</b>
          ,a Chola Emperor who reigned between 1014 and 1044 CE. He is considered the most significant ruler in early eleventh century South Asia for his role in patronising the arts, encouraging trade and expanding the Chola Empire to is greatest extent
        </p>
        <p>
          During his reign, the Chola Empire was the largest and most significant political, military, and economic force is in the Indian subcontinent, and extended its reach via trade and conquest across the Indian Ocean, making Rajendra one of only a handful of Indian monarchs to have conquered territory beyond South Asia. His early years were marked by his involvement in the Chola Army, where he fought in several campaigns against the Western Chalukyas as well as the rulers of Anuradhapura, earning him his first victories. He was also responsible for putting down rebellions in the Chera and Pandiya vassal states, and in Sri Lanka. As Emperor, he completed the conquest of Anuradhapura and brought a large portion of Sri Lanka under imperial rule.[9] Rajendra further expanded Chola rule by defeating the kingdoms of Kalinga and Vengai, and subduing the islands of Laccadives and the Maldives, which he renamed Munnir Palantivu Pannirayiram, meaning "Twelve Thousand Islands and the Ocean Where Three Waters Meet." These islands were later used as strategic naval bases. During his Southeast Asia campaign, he annexed Srivijaya, Kedah, Tambralinga and Pegu, achieving imperial dominance during his reign and cementing the Chola's continued influence in Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          To celebrate his victory in the Ganges, Rajendra constructed a new capital at Gangaikondacholapuram and built the Gangaikonda Choleeswarar Temple similar to the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur.
