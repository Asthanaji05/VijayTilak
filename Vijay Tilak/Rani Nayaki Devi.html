    <h3><i class="fa fa-sword"></i>The warrior queen</h3>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <P>
          She was a queen of the Chaulukya king Ajayapala.        </P>
        <p>She was married to Chaulukya ruler Ajayapala and had son named Mularaja, who later became king after his father's death. When her son succeeded his father as king in 1175, she became regent during the minority of her son
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1175, Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus, capturing Multan and Uch before penetrating in present-day Gujarat through the Thar Desert in 1178
          Muhammad of Ghor was routed by Mularaja II and his Rajput allies from Nadol, Jalore and Abu at the Battle of Kasahrada. The location of battle is identified as a village named Kayandra near foothills of Abu hills.
        </p>
        <p>
          she did receive aid from Chalukyan feudatories such as the leaders of the Naddula Chahamana clan, the Jalor Chahamana clan, and the Arbuda Paramara clan.

Realising that this wasn’t enough to defeat the massive hordes of enemy soldiers, the astute Naiki Devi carefully planned a battle strategy that would even out the odds. She chose the rugged terrain of Gadaraghatta — an area at the foot of Mount Abu near the village of Kasahrada (in the modern-day Sirohi district) — as the site of the battle.

        </p>
        <p>
          The narrow hill passes of Gadaraghatta was unfamiliar ground for Ghori’s invading army, giving Naiki Devi a huge advantage and balancing the odds in one masterful move. And so when Ghori and his army finally arrived Kasahrada, the fierce warrior queen rode into the battle with her son on her lap, leading her soldiers in a fierce counter-offensive. What followed was a rout.
