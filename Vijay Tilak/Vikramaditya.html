        <P>
          Vikramaditya was the king of Ujjain , who was famous for his wisdom, valor and generosity. He had organized his rule over the whole of Asia. King Vikramaditya had also defeated Rome's King Julius Caesar. The history of Rome itself writes that such a strong storm arose from the sea that we could not stop and that mighty army abducted our king. The proof of their rule over Arabia comes from the page number 315 of Sayar-ul-Okul book, this book was composed by Arabic poet Jarham Kitnoi. The text is currently housed in the Maktab-i-Sultaniya, a famous library in the city of Istanbul
