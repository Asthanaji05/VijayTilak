        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <P>
          a powerful ruler of the Karkota dynasty of Kashmir region in the Indian subcontinent.
        </P>
        <p>
          According to Kalhana, Lalitaditya defeated the central Indian king Yashovarman, and then marched to eastern and southern parts of India. He subjugated several more rulers on his way back to Kashmir, and then subdued several northern kings. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lalitaditya managed to create a short-lived empire that included major parts of India as well as present-day Afghanistan and Central Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lalitaditya is generally accepted as the most powerful king of his dynasty. He commissioned a number of shrines in Kashmir, including the now-ruined Martand Sun Temple. He also established several towns, including a new capital at Parihasapura, although he also maintained the dynasty's traditional capital at Srinagara
        </p>
        <p>
          After consolidating power in Kanyakubja, Lalitaditya proceeded to the eastern ocean, just like the Ganges river flows from the Himalayas to the eastern ocean. During this expedition,  Lalitaditya reached Kalinga and Gauda, and a number of elephants joined his army from Gauda
        </p>
        <p>
          From the eastern sea-shore, Lalitaditya proceeded to the southern region, where the Karnatas bowed down before him. 
          In the south, Lalitaditya's soldiers forgot their fatigue, as they sipped wine of the coconut trees and enjoyed the breeze on the banks of the Kaveri river.
          The Kashmiri king crossed the oceans via the islands, as one crosses a rivulet by stepping over stones.
          After crossing the ocean, Lalitaditya reached the seven Konkanas
        </p>
        <p>
          Having defeated most of the other kings, Lalitaditya proceeded from Avanti to Uttarapatha (the northern region), where he fought with several mighty kings

        </p>
        <p>After Lalitaditya, Afghanistan came under the control of the Hindu Shahi dynasty of Lalliya</p>
        <p>The Muslims from the west could not advance beyond Multan in Punjab during this period.</p>

        <p>
          the Karkota kingdom had peaceful relations with these Turkic neighbours: this very fact may have enabled Lalitaditya to leave Kashmir and lead troops to central and eastern India
        </p>
